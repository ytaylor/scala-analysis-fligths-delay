# scala-analysis-fligths-delay

This project use vuelos dataset fo perform predictive models using supervised learning algorithms and validate them cross way,  using Spark MLLib. This projetc include
* Definition of some Scala functions for preprocessing.
* Modeled with Spark and MLLib using Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
* Build an interactive and predictive model for flight delays
